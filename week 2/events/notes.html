           <h2>Program Structure</h2>
           <li>In some cases, JavaScript allows you to omit the semicolon at the end of a statement. In other cases, it has to be  
           there, or the next line will be treated as part of the same statement. The rules for when it can be safely omitted are 
           somewhat complex and error-prone. So in this book, every statement that needs a semicolon will always get one. </li>
           <li>full list of keywords and reserved words is rather long: break case catch class const continue debugger default delete 
           <br>do else enum export extends false finally for function if implements import interface in instanceof let new package 
           private protected public return static super switch this throw true try typeof var void while with yield</li>
           
           <h2>Functions</h2>
           <li>A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is a function.</li>
           <li>For example, this code defines square to refer to a function that produces the square of a given number: 
              const square = function(x) {  return x * x; }; console.log(square(12)); // → 144 </li>
           <li>A function can have multiple parameters or no parameters at all.</li>
           <li>Function declarations are not part of the regular top-to-bottom flow of control. They are conceptually moved to the 
              top of their scope and can be used by all the code in that scope. </li>
           <li>The arrow ( => ) comes after the list of parameters and is followed by the function’s body. It expresses something like “this
              input (the parameters) produces this result (the body)”.</li>
           <li>The place where the computer stores this context is the call stack. Every time a function is called, the current context is 
              stored on top of this stack. When a function returns, it removes the top context from the stack and uses that context to continue 
              execution.</li>
           <li>If you pass too many [parameters], the extra ones are ignored. If you pass too few, the missing parameters get assigned the 
              value undefined</li>
           <li>closure: being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scope</li>
           <li>recursive: a function that calls itself</li>
           <li>Running through a simple loop is generally cheaper than calling a function multiple times.</li>
           
           <h2>Data Structures: Objects and Arrays</h2>
           <li>Objects: allow us to group values—including other objects—to build more complex structures</li>
           <li>Array: a data type specifically for storing sequences of values; written as a list of values between square brackets, 
              separated by commas; the first index of an array is zero, not one.</li>
           <li>The two main ways to access properties in JavaScript are with a dot and with square brackets. Both value.x and 
              value[x] access a property on value—but not necessarily the same property.</li>
           <li>Whereas value.x fetches the property of value named “x”, value[x] tries to evaluate the expression x and 
              uses the result, converted to a string, as the property name.</li>
           <li>The binary "in" operator, when applied to a string and an object, tells you whether that object has a property with 
              that name. To find out what properties an object has, you can use the Object.keys function.</li>
           <li>To compute the measure of correlation between two Boolean variables, we can use the phi coefficient (ϕ). 
              This is a formula whose input is a frequency table containing the number of times the different combinations of 
              the variables were observed. The output of the formula is a number between -1 and 1 that describes the correlation. </li>
           <li>The corresponding methods for adding and removing things at the start of an array are called unshift and shift.</li>
           <li>The trim method removes whitespace (spaces, newlines, tabs, and similar characters) from the start and end of a string.</li>
           <li>Some other common methods: indexOf, padStart, split, join, repeat, length</li>
           <li>It can be useful for a function to accept any number of arguments. For example, Math.max computes the maximum of all 
              the arguments it is given.</li>
           <li>The Math object is used as a container to group a bunch of related functionality. There is only one Math object, and 
              it is almost never useful as a value. Rather, it provides a namespace so that all these functions and values do not have
              to be global bindings.</li>
           <li>JSON: JavaScript Object Notation. It is widely used as a data storage and communication format on the Web. Serializes 
              data or converts it into a flat description</li>
           <li>JSON looks similar to JavaScript’s way of writing arrays and objects, with a few restrictions. All property names 
              have to be surrounded by double quotes, and only simple data expressions are allowed—no function calls, bindings, or 
              anything that involves actual computation. Comments are not allowed in JSON.</li>
           <li>JavaScript gives us the functions JSON.stringify and JSON.parse to convert data to and from this format. The 
              first takes a JavaScript value and returns a JSON-encoded string. The second takes such a string and converts it to the 
              value it encodes.</li>
