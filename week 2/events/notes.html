        <h2>Program Structure</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>In some cases, JavaScript allows you to omit the semicolon at the end of a statement. In other cases, it has to be <br> 
          there, or the next line will be treated as part of the same statement. The rules for when it can be safely omitted are <br>
          somewhat complex and error-prone. So in this book, every statement that needs a semicolon will always get one. </li>
          <li>full list of keywords and reserved words is rather long: break case catch class const continue debugger default delete 
          <br>do else enum export extends false finally for function if implements import interface in instanceof let new package <br>
          private protected public return static super switch this throw true try typeof var void while with yield</li>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
