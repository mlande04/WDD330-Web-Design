    <h1>Week 07 - Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        <h2>Chapter 11: Further Functions</h2>
        <li><em>First-class objects:</em> they can be passed around in the same way as every other value</li>
        
        <h3>Function Properties and Methods</h3>
        <li>properties:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>length -> function.length</li>
          <li>can create "custom" properties: const bruce = { name: 'Bruce' }; -> property = name</li>
        </ol>
        <li>methods:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>call(): can be used to set value of <em>this</em> inside a function to an object that is provided as the first parameter</li>
          <li>   If a function doesn’t refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using the call() method, but you need provide null as its first argument.</li>
          <li>apply(): works like call() except arguments are provided as an array</li>
          <li>square.apply(null, [4]) > 16</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Immediately Invoked function expressions</h3>
        <li>anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it’s defined</li>
        <li>easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition</li>
        <li>easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition</li>
        <li>Example: <br>(function(){<br>const temp = 'World';<br>console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);<br>})();</li>
        <li>IIFEs are a useful way of performing a task while keeping any variables wrapped up within the scope of the function.</li>
        <li><em>Temporary Variables:</em> Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it’s only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear.</li>
        <li>An IIFE can be used to set up any <em>initialization code</em> that there’ll be no need for again.</li>
        <li>the recommended way to use <em>strict mode</em> is to place all your code inside an IIFE</li>
        <li>An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn’t interfere with any other part of the program.</li>
        
        <h3>Self-defining functions</h3>
        <li>This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that hasthe same name as the function.</li>
        <li>Example:<br>function party(){<br>    console.log('Wow this is amazing!');<br>    party = function(){<br>        console.log('Been <br>there, got the T-Shirt');<br>    }<br>}</li>
        <li>If any properties have previously been set on the function, these will be lost when the function redefines itself.</li>
        <li><em>Init-Time Branching:</em> functions that rewrite themselves</li>
        <li>This enables the functions to work more effectively in the browser, and avoid checking for features every time they’re invoked.</li>
        <ol>
          <li>we can define a function based on whether certain methods are supported</li>
          <li>only need to check for support the first time the function is called</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/11/k01nwv0w?fromShare=true">Example</a></li>
          <li>After we’ve checked whether the window.unicorn object exists, we’ve rewritten the ride() function according to the outcome.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Recursive functions</h3>
        <li>one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met</li>
        <li>It’s a useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/11/k01nwv1b?fromShare=true">Example: </a><br>function collatz(n, sequence=[n]) {<br>    if (n === 1){<br>        return `Sequence took ${sequence.length} steps. It was ${sequence}`;<br>    }<br>    if (n%2 === 0) {<br>        n = n/2;<br>    } else { <br>        n = 3*n + 1;<br>    }<br>    return collatz(n,<br><br>[...sequence,n]);<br>}</li>

        <h3>Callbacks</h3>
        <li>Covered in <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/4/k01nwtq1?fromShare=true">chapter 4 of Javascript: Novice to Ninja</a> on Sitepoint, 2nd edition</li>
        <li>they’re functions passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to</li>
        <li>Callbacks can be used to facilitate <em>event-driven asynchronous programming</em>.</li>
        <li>By using callbacks, we ensure that waiting for tasks to complete doesn't hold up the execution of other parts of the program.</li>
        <li>Here’s an example of a function called wait() that accepts a callback. To simulate an operation that takes some time to happen, we can use the setTimeout() function to call the callback after a given number of seconds:<br>function wait(message, callback, seconds){<br>    setTimeout(callback,seconds * 1000);<br>    console.log(message);<br>}</li>
        <li>create a callback function to use:<br>function selfDestruct(){<br>    console.log('BOOOOM!');<br>}</li>
        <li>If we invoke the wait() function then log a message to the console, we can see how JavaScript works asynchronously:<br>wait('This tape will self-destruct in five seconds ... ', selfDestruct, 5);<br>console.log('Hmmm, should I accept this mission or not ... ?');<br><< 'This tape will self-destruct in five seconds ... '<br><< 'Hmmm, should I accept this mission or not ... ? '<br><< 'BOOOOM!'</li>
        <li>a callback always has to wait for the current execution stack to complete before it’s invoked</li>
        <li><em>Callback hell:</em> messy and confusing 'spaghetti code' when more than one callback is used in the same function, resulting in a large number of nested blocks that are difficult to comprehend</li>
        <li><em>Error-first Callback Style: </em>have two arguments; first is the error argument, second argument is any data returned by the operation that can be used in the body of the callback</li>
        
        <h3>Promises</h3>
        <li>represents the future result of an asynchronous operation</li>
        <li>help simplify the process (don't do anything that can't already be achieved using callbacks)</li>
        <li><em>Life-cycle:</em></li>
        <ol>
          <li>When a promise is created, it calls an asynchronous operation and is then said to bepending.</li>
          <li>It remains in this state while the operation is taking place.</li>
          <li>At this stage, the promise is said to beunsettled.</li>
          <li>Once the operation has completed, the promise is said to have beensettled.</li>
          <li>A settled promise can result in two different outcomes:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.</li>
            <li>Rejected ― the asynchronous operation didn’t work as expected, wasn't successfully completed or resulted in an error.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Both these outcomes will return any relevant data, and you can take the appropriate action based on the outcome of the promise.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><em>Creating a Promise:</em></li>
        <ol>
          <li>created using a constructor function</li>
          <li>This takes a function called anexecutoras an argument.</li>
          <li>The executor initializes the promise and starts the asynchronous operation.</li>
          <li>It also accepts two functions as arguments: the resolve() function is called if the operation is successful, and the reject() function is called if the operation fails.</li>
          <li>Example:<br>const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {<br>    // initialization code goes here<br>    if (success) {<br>        resolve(value);<br>    } else {<br>        reject(error);<br>    }<br>});</li> 
        </ol>
        <li><em>Dealing With A Settled Promise:</em></li>
        <li>ONe option: the then() method can be used to deal with the outcome</li>
        <li>This method accepts two arguments.</li>
        <li>The first is a fulfilment function that’s called when the promise is resolved.<br>Any data returned from the resolve() function will be passed along to this function.</li>
        <li>The second argument is a rejection function that’s called if the promise is rejected. <br>Similar to the fulfillment function, the rejection function receives any data returned from the reject() function.</li>
        <li>Example: promise.then( result => console.log(`Yes! I rolled a ${result}`), result => console.log(`Drat! ... I rolled a ${result}`) );</li>
        <li>Alternatively, the catch() method can be used to specify what to do if the operation fails instead</li>
        <li>Example: promise.catch( result => console.log(`Drat! ... I rolled a ${result}`));</li>
        <li>The then() and catch() methods can be chained together to form a succinct description of how to deal with the outcome of the promise</li>
        <li>promise.then( result => console.log(`I rolled a ${result}`) )<br>            .catch( result => console.log(`Drat! ... I rolled a ${result}`) );</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/11/k01nwv33?fromShare=true">Try running an example in the browser</a></li>
        <li><em>Chaining Multiple Promises</em></li>
        <li>If each function that performs an asynchronous operation returns a promise, we can chain the then() methods together to form a sequential piece of code that’s easy to read.</li>
        <li>Each promise will only begin once the previous promise has been settled.</li>
        
        <h3>Async functions</h3>
        <li>preceded by the <em>async keyword</em> and allow you to write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous</li>
        <li>This is achieved by using the await operator before an asynchronous function.</li>
        <li>This will wrap the return value of the function in a promise that can then be assigned to a variable.</li>
        <li>The next line of code is not executed until the promise is resolved.</li>
        <li>Example:<br>async function loadGame(userName) {<br>    try {<br>        const user = await login(userName);<br>        const info = await getPlayerInfo (user.id);<br>        // load the game using the returned info<br>    }<br>    catch (error){<br>        throw error;<br>    }<br>}</li>
        
        <h3>Functions that return functions</h3>
        <li>Functions can return functions: <br>function returnHello() {<br>    console.log('returnHello() called');<br>    return function() {<br>        console.log('Hello World!');<br>    }<br>}</li>
        <li>To make use of the function that is returned, we need to assign it to a variable.</li>
        <li>invoke the function by placing parentheses after the variable that it was assigned to</li>
        <li>More <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/11/k01nwv45?fromShare=true">complex</a> example:<br>function greeter(greeting = 'Hello') {<br>    return function() {<br>        console.log(greeting);<br>    }<br>}<br><br>const englishGreeter = greeter();<br>englishGreeter();<br><< Hello<br><br>const frenchGreeter = greeter('Bonjour');<br>frenchGreeter();<br><< Bonjour<br><br>const germanGreeter = greeter('Guten Tag');<br>germanGreeter();<br><< Guten Tag</li>
        <li><em>Closures:</em> one of JavaScript’s most powerful features, but they can be difficult to get your head around initially</li>
        
        <h3>Closures</h3>
          <li>a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program</li>
          <li>One of the key principles in creating closures is that an 'inner' function, which is declared inside another function, has full access to all of the variables declared inside the scope of the function in which it’s declared (the 'outer' function).</li>
          <li>function outer() {<br>    const outside = 'Outside!';<br>    function inner() {<br>        const inside = 'Inside!';<br>        console.log(outside);<br>        console.log(inside);<br>    }<br>    console.log(outside);<br>    inner();<br>}</li>
          <li>The outer() function only has access to the variable outside , which was declared in its scope. The inner() function, however, has access to the variable inside , declared in its scope, but also the variable outside , declared outside its scope, but from within the outer() function.</li>
          <li>A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function, maintaining access to any variables declared inside the enclosing function.</li>
          <li>function outer() {<br>    const outside = 'Outside!';<br>    function inner() {<br>        const inside = 'Inside!';<br>        console.log(outside);<br>        console.log(inside);<br>    }<br>    return inner;<br>}</li>
          <li>We can now assign a variable to the return value of the outer() function: const closure = outer();</li>
          <li>The variable closure now points to the inner() function that is returned by the outer() function.</li>
          <li>What makes this a closure is that it now has access to the variables created insideboththe outer() and inner() functions.</li>
          <li>This is important as the variable outside should only exist while the outer() function is running.</li>
          <li>A closure doesn't just have access to the value of a variable, it can also change the value of the variable long after the function in which it was originally declared has been invoked.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/11/k01nwv4y?fromShare=true">Convert to Fahrenheit example</a> link</li>
          
        <h3>Generators</h3>
        <li>special functions used to produce iterators that maintain the state of a value</li>
        <li>To define a generator function, an asterisk symbol ( * ) is placed after the function declaration.</li>
        <li>Calling a generator function doesn’t actually run any of the code in the function; it returns a Generator object that can be used to create an iterator that implements a next() method that returns a value every time the next() method is called.</li>
        <li>function* fibonacci(a,b) {<br>    let [ prev,current ] = [ a,b ];<br>    while(true) {<br>        [prev, current] = [current, prev + current];<br>        yield current;<br>    }<br>}</li>
        <li>The code starts by initializing the first two values of the sequence, which are provided as arguments to the function. A while loop is then used, which will continue indefinitely due to the fact that it uses true as its condition, which will obviously always be true. Every time the iterator’s next() method is called, the code inside the loop is run, and the next value is calculated by adding the previous two values together.</li>
        <li>employ the special yield keyword that is used to return a value</li>
        <li>The difference between the yield and the return keywords is that by using yield , the state of the value returned is remembered the next time yield is called.</li>
        
        <h3>Introduction to functional programming</h3>
        <li>Fundamental elements:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>ability to pass functions as arguments</li>
          <li>return them from other functions</li>
          <li>use anonymous functions and closures</li>
        </ol>
        <li>a programming paradigm like object oriented programming and procedural programming</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, meaning that it can be used to program in a variety of paradigms (and sometimes a mash-up of them!). This flexibility is an attractive feature of the language, but it also makes it harder to adopt a particular coding style as the principles are not enforced by the language.</li>
        <li><em>Pure Functions:</em></li>
        <li>a function that adheres to the following rules:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>The return value of a pure function should only depend on the values provided as arguments. It doesn't rely on values from somewhere else in the program.</li>
          <li>There are no side-effects. A pure function doesn't change any values or data elsewhere in the program. It only makes non-destructive data transformations and returns new values, rather than altering any of the underlying data.</li>
          <li> Referential transparency. Given the same arguments, a pure function will always return the same result.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>In order to follow these rules, any pure function must have:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>At least one argument; otherwise the return value must depend on something other than the arguments of the function, breaking the first rule</li>
          <li>A return value; otherwise there’s no point in the function (unless it has changed something else in the program – in which case, it’s broken the 'no side-effects' rule).</li>
        </ol>
        <li><em>Benefits of Pure functions:</em></li>
        <ol>
          <li>help to make functional programming code more concise and predictable than in other programming styles</li>
          <li>Referential transparency makes pure functions easy to test as they can be relied on to return the same values when the same arguments are provided.</li>
          <li>any return values can be cached, since they’re always the same (see the section on Memoization above)</li>
          <li>The absence of any side-effects tends to reduce the amounts of bugs that can creep into your code, because there are no surprise dependencies as they only rely on any values provided as arguments.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Functional programming uses pure functions as the building blocks of a program. </li>
        <li>By only performing a single task, pure functions are more flexible, as they can be used as the building blocks for many different situations, rather than be tightly coupled with one particular operation.</li>
        <li><em>Higher-order functions</em> are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both.</li>
        <li>Closures are used extensively in higher-order functions as they allow us to create a generic function that can be used to then return more specific functions based on its arguments.</li>
        <li>When a higher-order function returns another function, we can use a neat trick to create an anonymous return function and immediately invoke it with a value instead by using double parentheses.</li>
        
        <h3>Currying</h3>
        <li>a process that involves the partial application of functions</li>
        <li>A function is said to be curried when not all arguments have been supplied to the function, so it returns another function that retains the arguments already provided, and expects the remaining arguments that were omitted when the original function was called.</li>
        <li>A final result is only returned once all the expected arguments have eventually been provided.</li>
        <li>Currying relies on higher-order functions that are able to return partially applied functions.</li>
        <li>All curried functions are higher-order functions because they return a function, but not all higher-order functions are curried.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/11/k01nwv7z?fromShare=true"><em>A General Curry Function:</em></a> function curry(func,...oldArgs) {<br>    return function(...newArgs) {<br>        const allArgs = [...oldArgs,...newArgs];<br>        return func(...allArgs);<br>    }<br>}</li>
        
        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <li>Functions have built-in properties such as length , but can have custom properties added.</li>
        <li>All functions have call() and apply() methods that can invoke a function with the value of this bound to an object that is provided as an argument.</li>
        <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs are functions that are enclosed in parentheses and immediately followed by double parentheses so they’re invoked. They are useful for namespacing variables and setting default values.</li>
        <li>Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function, depending on certain conditions.</li>
        <li>A recursive function will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met.</li>
        <li>A callback is a function that’s provided as an argument to another function.</li>
        <li>Callbacks are frequently used in asynchronous programming as part of the event loop. This means that a program can continue to run in a single thread while waiting for another task to be completed.</li>
        <li>Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors.</li>
        <li>Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.</li>
        <li>A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope of the function it was originally defined in.</li>
        <li>A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the function keyword.</li>
        <li>A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a next() method, which returns the next value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.</li>
        <li>Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied as a series of functions.</li>
        <li>Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they are called from, have no side-effects, and always give the same result when given the same arguments (referential transparency).</li>
        <li>Currying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at a time to a function. A new function is returned until all the arguments have been used.</li>
        
        <h2>Chapter 13: Ajax</h2>
        <li>A technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading.</li>
        <li>This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.</li>
        
        <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
        <li>A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client.</li>
        <li>A server is required when requesting resources using Ajax.</li>
        <li>Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client.</li>
        <li>The resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page.</li>
        <li>Typically this involves using a server-side language, such as PHP, Ruby, Node.js, or .NET to serve the data response following an Ajax request (usually from a back-end database).</li>
        <li>The <em>same-origin policy</em> in browsers blocks all requests from a domain that is different from the page making the request. This policy is enforced by all modern browsers and is to stop any malicious JavaScript being run from an external source. </li>
        <li><em>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</em> is a solution to this problem as it allows resources to be requested from another website outside the original domain. The CORS standard works by using HTTP headers to indicate which domains can receive data. A website can have the necessary information in its headers to allow external sites access to its API data. Most modern browsers support this method and respect the restrictions specified in the headers.</li>
        <li>Ajax was a neat acronym that referred to the different parts of the process being used:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Asynchronous</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>XML</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>The Fetch API: </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>a living standard for requesting and sending data asynchronously across a network</li>
          <li>uses promises to avoid callback hell, and also streamlines a number of concepts that had become cumbersome when using the XMLHttpRequest object</li>
          <li>provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch</li>
          <li>introduced the Response interface that deals with the object that’s returned when the promise is fulfilled</li>
          <li>Response objects have a number of properties and methods that allow us to process the response effectively:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>ok - has an ok property that checks to see if the response is successful</li>
            <li>status - which can be accessed using the status property</li>
            <li>headers – A Headers object (see later section) containing any headers associated with the response</li>
            <li>url – A string containing the URL of response</li>
            <li>redirected – A boolean value that specifies if the response is the result of a redirect</li>
            <li>type – A string value of 'basic', 'cors', 'error' or 'opaque'. </li>
            <li>-> A value of 'basic' is used for a response from the same domain. A value of 'cors' means the data was received from a valid cross-origin request from a different domain. A value of 'opaque' is used for a response received from 'no-cors' request from another domain, which means access to the data will be severely restricted. A value of 'error' is used when a network error occurs.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>The response object also contains a number of methods that return promises that can then be chained together.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><em>Redirects:</em> The redirect() method can be used to redirect to another URL. It creates a new promise that resolves to the response from the redirected URL.</li>
        <li>***At the present time, there is no support for the redirect() method in any browser.</li>
        <li><em>Text Responses:</em> The text() method takes a stream of text from the response, reads it to completion and then returns a promise that resolves to a USVSting object that can be treated as a string in JavaScript.</li>
        <li><em>File Responses:</em> The blob() method is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet. </li>
        <li><em>JSON Responses:</em> the most common format for AJAX responses. The json() method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</li>
        <li><em>Creating Response Objects:</em> you can also create your own response objects using a constructor function</li>
        <li>These can be useful to use if you are creating an API that needs to send a response, or if you need to send a dummy response for testing purposes.</li>
        <li><em>Request Interface:</em> get more fine-grained control over the request being made by providing a Request object as an argument</li>
        <li>created using the Request() constructor, and include the following properties:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>url – The URL of the requested resource (the only property that is required)</li>
          <li>method – a string that specifies which HTTP method should be used for the request. By default, this is 'GET'</li>
          <li>headers – This is a Headers object (see later section) that provides details of the request's headers</li>
          <li>mode – Allows you to specify if CORS is used or not. CORS is enabled by default</li>
          <li>cache – Allows you to specify how the request will use the browser's cache</li>
          <li>credentials – Lets you specify if cookies should be allowed with the request</li>
          <li>redirect – Specifies what to do if the response returns a redirect:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>'follow' (the redirect is followed)</li>
            <li>'error' (an error is thrown)</li>
            <li>'manual' (the user has to click on a link to follow the redirect)</li>
          </ol>
        </ol>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
